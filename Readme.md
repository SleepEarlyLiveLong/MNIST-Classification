# MNIST Classification

This project includes some sub-projects where several solutions for a classification of the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset are proposed. It comes from a small project in the Digital Image Processing class during my 6th semester in Wuhan University in Autumn 2017. Till the end of 2018, TWO solutions are realized, they are the [kmeans-KNN classification]() and the [NaiveBayesclassification](https://github.com/chentianyangWHU/MNIST-Classification/tree/master/NaiveBayes). Here is the file structure:

```
MNIST Classification
              |-- kmeans-KNN
              |-- NaiveBayes
              |-- Readme.md
```
Among the files above:
- in folder 'kmeans-KNN': there is a detailed introduction for how to employee a kmeans-KNN classification for MNIST handwritting recognition;
- in folder 'NaiveBayes': there is a detailed introduction for how to employee a NaiveBayes classification for MNIST handwritting recognition;

Now, just have a look!
